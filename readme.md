## Anthropic SDK Sandbox
This project contains various blocks of code utilizing the Anthropic SDK for testing Claude's responses to a multitude of (predominantly scientific) queries across different model versions.

## Essential First Step
Before executing any queries to Claude, the user must first set set their environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to an active Anthropic API key. 
Simply running `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>` inside the Linux container's command line will update the value appropriately.
