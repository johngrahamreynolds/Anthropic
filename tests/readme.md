## Interesting Topics for Testing and Improvement

##### - Can we implement a Latex compiler to immediately compile and produce Latex files for Claude's generation of mathematical formulas? Would extending Claude's functionality to have access to such a compiler make his responses and ability to communicate much clearer? âœ… Now how can we think about implementing such a use case into the web app UI? Would such a PDF file that our porject generates be sent to the browser's downloads? Can we render it somehow in the UI?

##### - Can we implement Cadabra into Claude for the solving of complex systems of equations? Think in terms of problems related to Cadabra's motivation: high-dimensional, highly non-linear derivatives in field theory. Can we combine Claude, Cadabra, and a tex compiler to produce elegant mathematical outputs as one would expect in modern research papers, review notes, or texts?

##### - A relevant challenge for giving Claude access to a code execution envrionment is knowing what packages he needs to have pre-installed to run the algorithm or program in question. Take for example the issue of simulating quantum algorithms and quantum circuits using Cirq or Qiskit. These are obviously very non-trivial Python SDKs that would absolutely not be installed in a basic Python development container. Can we / should we use nested containerization to spin up containerized development/ code execution environments that have specific use cases? General Python execution containers, scientific computing and research containers, etc.?
