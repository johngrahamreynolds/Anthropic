## Interesting Topics for Testing and Improvement

##### - Can we implement a Latex compiler to immediately compile and produce Latex files for Claude's generation of mathematical formulas? Would extending Claude's functionality to have access to such a compiler make his responses and ability to communicate much clearer?

##### - Can we implement Cadabra into Claude for the solving of complex systems of equations? Think in terms of problems related to Cadabra's motivation: high-dimensional, highly non-linear derivatives in field theory. Can we combine Claude, Cadabra, and a tex compiler to produce elegant mathematical outputs as one would expect in modern research papers, review notes, or texts?
